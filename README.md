# run-samEst
Workshop on using the samEst R package - non-stationary spawner-recruit models for Pacific salmon


# Before the workshop

## Dependencies
samEst depends on the R >= 4.0.5, make sure your R version is compatible. 

samEst depends on the R packages TMB and the latest version of stan. So we need to ensure that these packages are installed and working. To install and test the dependencies before installing samEst run code/install_samEst.R

## Data 
You can run the workshop on your own data or examples can be provided. Let Dan Greenberg (dan.greenberg@dfo-mpo.gc.ca) and Catarina Wor (catarina.wor@dfo-mpo.gc.ca) know in advance if you would like to be assigned an example data set.


# TODO

-write scripts for the workshop
 - Read in data (your own or examples provided).
 - Run TMB models (stan would take too long??)
